Odyssey 1 - Tell me, Muse, of that man, so ready at need, who wandered far and wide, after he had sacked the sacred  
citadel of Troy, and many were the men whose towns he saw and whose mind he learnt, yea, and many  
the woes he suffered in his heart on the deep, striving to win his own life and the return of his company.  
Nay, but even so he saved not his company, though he desired it sore. For through the blindness of their  
own hearts they perished, fools, who devoured the oxen of Helios Hyperion: but the god took from them  
their day of returning. Of these things, goddess, daughter of Zeus, whencesoever thou hast heard thereof,  
declare thou even unto us.  
Now all the rest, as many as fled from sheer destruction, were at home, and had escaped both war and  
sea, but Odysseus only, craving for his wife and for his homeward path, the lady nymph Calypso held,  
that fair goddess, in her hollow caves, longing to have him for her lord. But when now the year had come  
in the courses of the seasons, wherein the gods had ordained that he should return home to Ithaca, not  
even there was he quit of labours, not even among his own; but all the gods had pity on him save Poseidon,  
who raged continually against godlike Odysseus, till he came to his own country. Howbeit Poseidon had now  
departed for the distant Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that are sundered in twain, the uttermost of men,  
abiding some where Hyperion sinks and some where he rises. There he looked to receive his hecatomb of  
bulls and rams, there he made merry sitting at the feast, but the other gods were gathered in the halls of  
Olympian Zeus. Then among them the father of men and gods began to speak, for he bethought him in his  
heart of noble Aegisthus, whom the son of Agamemnon, far-famed Orestes, slew. Thinking upon him he  
spake out among the Immortals: ‘Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For of us they  
say comes evil, whereas they even of themselves, through the blindness of their own hearts, have sorrows  
beyond that which is ordained. Even as of late Aegisthus, beyond that which was ordained, took to him  
the wedded wife of the son of Atreus, and killed her lord on his return, and that with sheer doom before  
his eyes, since we had warned him by the embassy of Hermes the keen-sighted, the slayer of Argos, that  
he should neither kill the man, nor woo his wife. For the son of Atreus shall be avenged at the hand of  
Orestes, so soon as he shall come to man’s estate and long for his own country. So spake Hermes, yet he  
prevailed not on the heart of Aegisthus, for all his good will; but now hath he paid one price for all.’  
And the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, saying: ‘O father, our father Cronides, throned in the  
highest; that man assuredly lies in a death that is his due; so perish likewise all who work such deeds! But  
my heart is rent for wise Odysseus, the hapless one, who far from his friends this long while suffereth  
affliction in a sea-girt isle, where is the navel of the sea, a woodland isle, and therein a goddess hath her  
habitation, the daughter of the wizard Atlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself upholds the  
tall pillars which keep earth and sky asunder. His daughter it is that holds the hapless man in sorrow:  
and ever with soft and guileful tales she is wooing him to forgetfulness of Ithaca. But Odysseus yearning  
to see if it were but the smoke leap upwards from his own land, hath a desire to die. As for thee, thine  
heart regardeth it not at all, Olympian! What! Did not Odysseus by the ships of the Argives make thee  
free offering of sacrifice in the wide Trojan land? Wherefore wast thou then so wroth with him, O Zeus?’12345

Gettysburg Address 1 - Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation,
conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
“Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so
conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war.
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who
here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper
that we should do this. “But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,
we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have
consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note,
nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is
for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who
fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated
to the great task remaining before us,that from these honored dead we take increased
devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion, that we
here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation,
under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the
people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.11111
