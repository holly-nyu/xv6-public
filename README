halloween originated from the ancient celtic festival of samhain, celebrated around october 31. 
this festival marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter. celts believed that 
on this night, the boundary between the living and the dead became blurred, allowing spirits to 
roam the earth. to ward off these wandering souls, people would light bonfires and wear 
costumes.over time, samhain evolved into a more christianized holiday known as all hallows' 
eve, which was the night before all saints' day. by the 9th century, all hallows' eve was celebrated 
with feasting and various customs, such as "souling," where the poor would go door to door 
asking for food in exchange for prayers for the dead. in the 19th century, irish immigrants 
brought halloween traditions to the united states, where it gained popularity. the practice of 
carving pumpkins, known as jack-o'-lanterns, originated from the irish custom of hollowing out 
turnips to create lanterns. as the holiday evolved, it became more focused on community 
activities and fun, leading to the modern tradition of trick-or-treating. today, halloween is 
celebrated with costumes, parties, and various spooky themes, embracing its rich history while 
evolving into a festive occasion.
